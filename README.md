# So it begins

This is a long term project idea pulled from being tired of wasted potential of games like Fallout 4. This is intended to be a back end framework for RPGS, with frameworks for stat tracking, leveling, locations, spawns, NPCs, factions, reputation systems, and the impression of a living world(ie, it changes without player input).

I chose C++ because I love C++. Fight me.
